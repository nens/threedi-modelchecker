  2d_boundary_conditions and 2d_lateral.
- Add check for open cross-section when NumericalSettings.use_of_nested_newton is
  turned off.
- Add checks to ensure some of the fields in numericalSettings are larger than 0.
- Add check to ensure an isolated pipe always has a storage area.
- Add check to see if a connection_node is connected to an artifact
  (pipe/channel/culvert/weir/pumpstation/orifice).

-------------------

- Changed Pipe.calculation_type to include broad- and shortcrest.

-------------------

- Bugfix: made the `ConnectionNodesLength` backwards compatible with sqlalchemy 1.1.


0.10 (2020-05-06)
-----------------

- Added `ConnectionNodesLength` check to check the length between a start- and end node
  is above a certain threshold. Configured this check for pipes, weirs and orifices.

- Configured checks to see if the length of a linestring geometry is larger than 0.05m
  for culverts and channels.

- Chaned GlobalSettings.start_date and GlobalSetting.start_time into type Text and
  added two checks to see if the fields are valid datetime and date respectively.

- Configured extra check: use_1d_flow must be set to True when your model has 1d
  elements.

- Removed `ConditionalCheck` and replaced it with `QueryCheck`.

- Added type-hinting.

- Created `CustomEnum` for `Enum` objects.


0.9 (2019-11-27)
----------------

- Fixed some misconfigured checks, see https://github.com/nens/threedi-modelchecker/issues/10.

----------------

- Set language of travis to python and test for python 3.6 and 3.7.

- Update to following columns to be non-nullable: Levee.the_geom,
  Culvert.invert_level_start_point and Culvert.invert_level_end_point.

- Removed threedigrid from requirements.

- Configured extra checks: Pumpstation.lower_stop_level > Manhole.bottom_level.

- Configured extra checks: Pipe.invert_level >= .Manhole.bottom_level.

- Added additional check type: QueryCheck.


0.7 (2019-07-18)
----------------

- Fix setup.py.


0.6 (2019-07-18)
----------------

----------------

- Update to readme.
- No longer raise a MigrationTooHighError when the migration is larger than expected.


0.3 (2019-07-08)
----------------

- Fixed TypeError with CrossSectionShapeCheck when width/height are `None`.
- Updated some constraints on CrossSectionShapeCheck:
  - Heights of tabulated shape must be increasing.
  - Egg only requires a width, which must be greater than 0.
- Added 0 to a valid value for ZoomCategories. Also renamed the ZoomCategories names 
  to something clear names.


0.2 (2019-06-12)
----------------

- Renamed some methods of ThreediModelChecker.
- Added basic to the 3di model schema: checks if the model has the latest migration 
  applied and raises an error if not.
- Rewrote CrossSectionShape check to no longer use regex and added it to config.


0.1 (2019-06-04)
----------------

- Initial project structure.
- Added ORM for a threedi-model in sqlalchemy.
- Added several types of checks.
- Manually configured many checks.
